The walls are closing in
and I feel like I'm gonna break
My light is growing dim
And I don't know how much I can take
Now my mind begins to replay
every scene I hate,
And I feel so trapped inside this place
But I just can't escape
Can anybody hear me
As I'm crying out for help
I can't find the way out
There's no exit in hell
Why why why
