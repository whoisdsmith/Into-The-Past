I Guess it's time to finally admit it's the end
Cause there is no chance for us to ever be again
Too much damage done that you could never mend
And when it comes to you I break instead of bend
You can tell the world how it was all my fault
You can blame me for the death of Jensen blame me for it all
Its just so you feel better and I take the fall
I'll be the villian in our story when you talk
Just remember who was there when you fell apart
Just remember that I always gave you my heart
Just remember that it was me tryna to lead you out the dark
Just remember it was you that lied to me at the start
I just don't get it
I tried to be the light in your dark
But you didn't want to see it
I lit the way with open arms
But you couldn't accept it
tried to committ
tried to transmit
tried to emit,
But you just quit
Let darkness win
Don't give a shit
I'm sorry that
I couldn't save you
I tried my best
but my light won't reach you
I would have stayed
And been lost with you
But you locked me out
And let the darkness take you
There was a time when you could see me
But I gues now you only see right through me
It's like I'm not even here in front of you
There's more to life than the dark that surrounds you
Let me paint you this picture of my mind
Take a seat, listen to me, hard to describe
The horrors trapped inside of me and I am over run by anxiety it gets the best of me and one day maybe it will be the end of me
It's the enemy I can't breathe the dark is right in front of me it's smothering
