I wonder how many times
You can hurt someone you love
before they take their own life
Because they felt not enough
Don't stop drinking
just cause I need you here with me
Don't start worrying
As I bleed out in the bathtub please
I'm sorry love but you fucking kill me
Every time you chose to ignore me
Tell me why I'm not enough
when I just wanted you to
give a fuck
