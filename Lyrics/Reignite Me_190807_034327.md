There's a light burning its way out of the darkness inside me
I can feel the heat and see all of the changes that it brings
I'm finally becoming the person I was always meant to be
I just want my friends and family to be proud of me
The light Sparks
And vanishes the dark
Today is a brand new day
And I'm not gonna let it go to waste
On shit from yesterday
Cause I have found a way
To live my life and be ok
There is a light
I see it glow
from the inside
Turning darkness into white
and making way for a better life
I just wanted you to know
This time I let you go
I hope you do the same
