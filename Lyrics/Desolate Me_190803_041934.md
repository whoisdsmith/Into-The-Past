It all started with something about myself
I'm always looking for a place that I can go
And I don't even know
Tell you how I'm feeling inside
And I don't know what I'm trying to do anymore
Looking for an exit while I'm going through the door
But I've been steady pacing
Since I reformed my own ways
My own mind try to do it all right
Try to make it on time oh no
Tell me where do I go?
