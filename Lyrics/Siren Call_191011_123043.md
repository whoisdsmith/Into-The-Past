What is my purpose
cause I been feeling so worthless
I'm so tired of being hurt and
I'm just ready to be free of this curse
Maybe one day
I will find a way to be ok
and shit will finally change
instead of being the same
So lead me out in the rain
And watch me drown like it's all the same
Yea yea
Cause I can't get away
from all this shit up in brain
And I'm tired of the chase
when all it does is bring me pain
Let it go
Learn to control
What hurts the most
Time it moves slow
Don't lose your hope
Build a new home
Somewhere you can grow
Love and let go
Don't give up now
I'll guide you out
I know I'm not worthless
Now that I have found my purpose
I finally opened up the curtains
And I'm no longer hurtin
So lead me out of the dark
And try and restart that light in my heart
Yea yea
