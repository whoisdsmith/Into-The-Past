I'm sorry that I couldn't save you
I tried my best but my light won't reach you
I would have stayed And been lost with you
But you locked me out And let the darkness take you
I Guess it's time to finally admit it's the end
Cause there is no chance for us to ever be again
Too much damage done that you could never mend
And when it comes to you I break instead of bend
You can tell the world how it was all my fault
You can blame me for the death of Jensen blame me for it all
Its just so you feel better and I take the fall
I'll be the villian in our story when you talk
I'm sorry that
I couldn't save you
I tried my best
but my light won't reach you
I would have stayed
And been lost with you
But you locked me out
And let the darkness take you
