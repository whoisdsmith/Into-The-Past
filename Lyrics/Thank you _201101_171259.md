I just want to thank you for everything you've done for me and I promise I will repay you with all I have, when I'm on my feet.

Yeah it's just begun, my life is finally looking up and I can smile again. Feels like I'm finally alive again. It's been so long, yeah, that I have seen the sun cause my depression held me hostage with a fucking gun. My anxiety, it told me I would never leave and I will never be anything cause that's just what my wife believed and than it hit me, I was right where she wanted me to be.

These last two years have been the fucking hardest.

Didn't think that I would make it this far and

I know that I am grateful, I just want to say that I'm thankful.

I just want to thank you for everything you've done for me and I promise I will repay you with all I have, when I'm on my feet.
