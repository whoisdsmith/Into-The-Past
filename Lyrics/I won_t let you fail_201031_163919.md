Life is what you make it
don't live your life in a casket
Just a little longer now
I promise I'll guide you out
Been a long time since I've been happy
But I know most of that was all my fault
Didn't see the right way to live
cuz I was living my own way
I promised that I would take all that pain and put it on to everyone that ever hurt me
Yeah I swear to you that's the only way
The only way to fail now
Cuz I was wrong in every way
Nothing gets solved by negativity
Promise I'll guide you
just grab my hand we'll go together
Make it out of all these embers in December promise you, you'll remember
All the things that I tell you
cuz imma do it right
The right way the only way I know now
And I ain't never going to let you down now
I love you.
no matter where you are
no matter what you do
no matter what you've done
stay true to you
Cuz I won't let you fail
No I wont let you fail
Cuz you're too good
to fall to the dark ever again
I'll hold the light
I'll make it right
please take my hand
together we'll leave this place
