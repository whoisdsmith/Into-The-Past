Where do I go at night when I'm all alone
And you're no where to be found?
Late nights keep me awake for so long, so long now.
When am I going to ever find myself man?
When am I going to get some help for myself?
I just need to find my way again.
Fighting through the pain almost everyday, I just need to get away, don't you think?
Don't you think it's about time that I just get my life right for once so I can move along?
Tell me now!
I just need to clear my head and need to get my life right again.
I don't know why I'm fuckin Killin time.
I hope that you're doing fine this time.
Wake up tell me that you care
and tell me that you gonna be there and look at me now and telling me how all this shit is in my brain, I know, it's time to take control of everything that I know I know that I need to get back on my feet and.....
So if you were to ask me if I would do it all over again
the answer is always going to be the same absolutely.
my greatest memory was that day we met at Barnes and Nobles parking lot
and you came walking up in that yellowcard shirt with those cute ass boots on. I was so fucking nervous that I just looked stupid probably.
You asked me if you could kiss me and I've been fucked up ever since.
I really hope you know
that I'm trying now
To let it all go right out
To find some peace and move on now
This shit is killing me
It's killing me
I know I've been so hard to be around
You can hear it in my voice as I lose it now
When all I do is scream & shout
Cuz I feel like you can't hear me now
What is love without trust
Without trust there isn't much
What is love without trust
Without trust there isn't much
Do I give up?
Do I say all the things
That made me the person that I never wanted to be?
Do I give a fuck? Yea
I really give a fuck now
Imma get it right
Imma get right with my life this time
Imma get it right
Swear to God I'm going to get it right this time, this time
Imma get right with my life this time
Imma get it right, right, right
And I'll see you in another life
I'm gonna get this right
And I'll see you in another life
I'm gonna get it right
Swear to God this time
I'm gonna get it right
