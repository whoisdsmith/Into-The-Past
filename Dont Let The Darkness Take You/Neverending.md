# Neverending

---

I hope that you're ok this time around
I hope that you're alright, that you're ok
Call my name out loud, Hear me now
One thing that I feel
is always gonna be real
To deal with, I know it
Is It's hard to fucking feel
anything, anymore without you
I still love you
And I feel it in my bones
When I'm without you
