# Youre The Best

---

It's been 2 years now that I'm still at my mom's
I hope she's knows I'm so thankful for all that she's done
Not just for me but for my children too
Cause we all been through the ringer, including you (and you have too)
I know I've been a wreck,
I been a mess
and that I cannot handle my stress
but I Promise I am tryin my best
to start being myself again
But I'm not sure who the hell I am
I gave everything to those who don't give a damn
I don't need a hand, I need a plan
I need you to understand
Right now I am a broken man
I'm doing all that I can
To put this into action
With a lighter and a gas can
I'll light
While I hit the gas and
And get some cash for
The bitch who is too bad
