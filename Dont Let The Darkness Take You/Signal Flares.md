# Signal Flares

---

To the world I'm just locked inside my room
But really I'm locked inside my head of doom
All black walls, all dark thoughts,
ghosts that haunt got me cold like frost
and I'm scared
that I won't find my way out
Cause I can't see anything
but the dark inside me right now
Where do I go when there's nowhere to go
Where do I go when I can't find my way out
No key, I can't see anything,
so dark, black walls, all these dark thoughts now.
lead me out.
Im so cold
I just need a coat now
I just need some help now
Do you hear me
I'm sending out flares now
Can you come and find me?
