# Starting Over

---

It's about time that I dig myself 
out of the grave you left me in,
it's about time I move on with my life, 
so I can begin again.
Cause Life is what you make it 
and I don't want to hate it.
I know that I must face it, 
cause shit I cannot change it.

I take my thoughts and 
I turn them into songs.
Try to paint a picture of how 
my life it all went wrong.
And I try to tell myself 
that I have to stay strong.
And convince myself 
somehow that I do belong.
