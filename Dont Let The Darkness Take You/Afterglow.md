# Afterglow

---

If You ask me how I'm doin,
I'm a tell you that I'm fine
I'm a mess but still I keep on goin
Cause I'm trying to be the light

Lately I've been thinking
That maybe I just need a change of pace
and something to believe In
Cause my mind been feeling vacant
And my thoughts they just keep on wastin away
And I'm not tryna fade
I'm tryna glow and be great,
rid out all the hate,
change all of my ways
so nothing stays the same
find a better place
so that I can light the way

If You ask me how I'm doin,
I'm a tell you that I'm fine
I'm a mess but still I keep on goin
Cause I'm trying to be the light
