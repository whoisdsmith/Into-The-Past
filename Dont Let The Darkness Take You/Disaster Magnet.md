Lie to me, please lie to me
Please lie to me, please lie to me
Make me believe I am worth nothin
My thoughts they hauntin
They are not stoppin
Migraines are throbbin
It happens often
You keep on watchin
Hopin I drop in
down in my coffin
Lie to me, please lie to me
Please lie to me, please lie to me
And Make me believe
That Everything
Is Not what it seems
But it's what it seems
Cause it's what I see
And I need a drink
Just let go of me
So I can be free
And finally breathe
You're not what I need
