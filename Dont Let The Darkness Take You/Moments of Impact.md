# Moments of Impact

---

I wonder how you're doing now
Are you happy And better off now
Or do you still think about
The times we had and get filled with doubt?

I can't change you
I don't want to
I can't hate you
Cause all I do is love you
I can't change you
I don't want to
I can't hate you
Cause all I do is love you

Oh I remember
when you smiled At me
for the first time.
I knew you were my everything
Since that November
When we first kissed I
knew you were the one thing
I would always cherish
I'd always want to marry
