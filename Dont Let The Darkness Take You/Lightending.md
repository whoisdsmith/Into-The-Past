# Lightending

Is this really how the story ends?
Two lovers who can't even be friends
I just want you to be happy
Cause That's what I do
when I love somebody
I Don't care if you don't love me
That's just who I am
And I won't apologize for caring

Don't look so surprised
You knew that's how I was
When we kissed the first time
And we both knew it was love
I guess our fate don't align
Cause in the end we just gave up
So I guess this is goodbye
I'll See you in another life
You ain't even mine
Was it all a lie,
Why do you run and hide
Wasting your time
I need therapy for my dark mind
I just need to find some peace inside
Cause I can no longer see the light
Now all my days are the darkest nights
Just give me some drugs
So I can fall asleep
Make my body go numb
So I can't feel a thing
