# Dayone


---

Day one of my new life
No more looking back this is goodbye
Time to focus on the dark to bring forth light
Shedding tears, shedding fears, it's gon be alright
I talked to God he gave me a sign
Told him imma get it right this time
Need to focus on being a better man
So I can give a ðŸ’¯ everywhere I am
